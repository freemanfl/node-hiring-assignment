# Assignment for Junior Backend Developer applicant: Instant Messaging Application

## Objective
Design and implement a simple application for instant messaging where two or more people can connect and chat in real time.

## User Story
1. User opens the app and picks a name/nickname.
1. User automatically joins the global group chat.
1. User can type and send messages. Other users immediately receive them.

* Analysis and Overall Approach: How well you understand and approach the problem.
* Design and Architecture: How you structure and design the solution.
* Code Quality: Clean, readable, and maintainable code.
* Working with Git: Effective use of version control with meaningful commit messages.
* Automatic Testing: Quality and coverage of automated tests.

## Expected Result
Fork this repository and submit a pull request with your solution. Your submission should include the following:

* Multiple commits reflecting your development process.
* Fully working code.
* Automated tests ensuring the functionality of your code.
* A README file with instructions on how to run the application.

**Good luck! ðŸš€**
